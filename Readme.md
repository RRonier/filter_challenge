## General questions - Answers

- How much time did you spend working on the solution?
* I worked almost five hours, but not continuously.

- Whatâ€™s the part of the solution you are most proud of?
  _You can share a code snippet here if you feel like it_
  * The folder structure is the part I'm proud the most. I triyed to set the project as if it was a mid-size project, I triyed to extract as much components as I could and to make them reusable throughtout the solution, and separate the components from the containers as much as I could. 

- If you had more time, what other things you would like to do?
    * It would be great to write some test cases to ensure the code is working as we expected.
    * Create a generic function to manipulate pagination in backend-side.
    * Add other endpoints to get customs filters.
    * Use styled-components instead of tailwind. You can find options like React Material (MUI) or AntD.
- Do you have any feedback regarding this coding challenge?  
  _Is the initial setup working?, is something missing?, or any other comment_
    * Regarding this question, I should highlight a few points.
      1- The commands to set up the projects are not written correctly. I assumed this is a pitfall for the developer, and a tricky part of the challenge     for those whose haven't use Docker before. The correct command is docker-compose, not docker compose.
      2- I was unable to install dependencies easily, so I added --ignore-engines to the instalation to be able to install dependencies properly.
      3- This is supposed to be a Frontend challenge, but I had to work on the backend as well, in order to deliver the best solution to the filter part. Maybe that's part of the complexity of the challenge, just saying.

PD: I enjoyed this challenge. Thank you very much
